# Webmap-Leaflet-with-Folium

##  How to use the application

The Project contains **map.py** as the primary script. On running the script, a html file will be generated. 
This html file can be opened on any standard web browser and the webmap leaflet will be displayed. There are options to choose map tiles according to preference within the script.
Here I have used sample data in csv format. Please download the "Sample_Data_Volcano_USA.txt" file along with the script to see the corresponding web map.

## Future Work
- [ ] Adding Choropleth map from GeoJSON data source
